**Hand it a raw MFT record, get back severity-graded NTFS anomalies — timestomping, alternate data streams, deleted records, and record slack as `forensicnomicon::report::Finding`s.**

```toml
[dependencies]
ntfs-forensic = "0.5"   # pulls in ntfs-core
```

```rust
use ntfs_forensic::audit_record;
use forensicnomicon::report::Source;

let src = Source { analyzer: "ntfs-forensic".into(), scope: "NTFS".into(), version: None };

for anomaly in audit_record(&mft_record_bytes) {
    let finding = anomaly.to_finding(src.clone());
    println!("[{:?}] {} — {}", finding.severity, finding.code, finding.note);
    // e.g. [Some(High)] NTFS-TIMESTOMP — $SI created before $FN …
}
```

`audit_record` parses the record header and attributes, extracts `$STANDARD_INFORMATION`/`$FILE_NAME`, and grades what it finds. A record whose header does not parse yields no anomalies (structural corruption is surfaced by the reader/carver, never a panic). Already have parsed components? Skip the re-parse and call `audit_components(record_number, header, record, attributes, si, fname)`.

## The anomaly codes

Each anomaly is an **observation** ("consistent with …"); the examiner draws the conclusions. Codes are a stable, published contract.

| Code | Severity | What it observes |
|---|---|---|
| `NTFS-TIMESTOMP` | High | `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` times show forgery tells vs. the harder-to-forge `$FILE_NAME` times (`$SI` predates `$FN`, or lands on a whole second) |
| `NTFS-ADS` | Low | A named `$DATA` attribute — an alternate data stream (also used benignly, e.g. `Zone.Identifier`) |
| `NTFS-SLACK-RESIDUE` | Low | Non-zero residue in an MFT record's slack, past its used size |
| `NTFS-DELETED-RECORD` | Info | An MFT record not in use — a recoverable deleted file |
| `NTFS-MFTMIRR-MISMATCH` | High | A system record in `$MFT` differs from its `$MFTMirr` copy |
| `NTFS-LOGFILE-CLEARED` | Medium | `$LogFile` shows restart-area gaps consistent with the journal having been cleared |

The first four come from `audit_record` / `audit_components`. The volume-level pair come from `audit_mft_mirror($MFT, $MFTMirr)` and `audit_logfile($LogFile)`, returning `ArtifactAnomaly`s that also convert via `to_finding(source)`.

## The building blocks

`audit_record` is composed from pure, side-effect-free primitives you can call directly:

- `detect_timestomp(si, file_name)` → `TimestompIndicators { si_created_before_fn, created_mismatch, si_whole_second }`
- `alternate_data_streams(attributes)` → the named `$DATA` attributes
- `record_slack(record, header)` → the bytes past the record's used size
- `is_deleted(header)` → record not currently allocated
- `carve_file_records(mft, record_size)` → offsets of `FILE`/`BAAD` records in a raw `$MFT` region

## The two-crate split

This crate is the **analyzer**; the **reader** is [`ntfs-core`](https://crates.io/crates/ntfs-core) (`$MFT`, attributes, indexes, data runs, LZNT1, `NtfsFs` path navigation over any `Read + Seek` source). The split mirrors `vmdk-core`/`vmdk-forensic`. Together they back [`issen`](https://github.com/SecurityRonin/issen) and [`usnjrnl-forensic`](https://github.com/SecurityRonin/usnjrnl-forensic).

## Trust, but verify

Built for untrusted disk images from potentially compromised systems: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; panic-free on crafted input (the workspace denies `clippy::unwrap_used` / `expect_used` in production code); `ntfs-core` is fuzzed with seven `cargo-fuzz` targets, cross-validated against The Sleuth Kit and the `mft` crate on real disk images, and held at 100% line coverage in CI.
